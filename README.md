# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

Simbi is a side project that served as my playground for diving into Next 13 and Next-Auth. In this project, I crafted a database abstraction layer that leverages Neon's PostgreSQL offering. This layer includes features like transaction management and connection pooling, making data management more efficient and robust. To this end, I also utilized Zod for modeling and implemented Data Access Objects (DAOs) for more structured data interactions. As for Next-Auth, I designed a custom Simbi Adapter to seamlessly integrate with my data-fetching solution.

The core objective behind Simbi was to explore the exciting possibilities around React Server Components and the Next.js ecosystem. Specifically, I aimed to deepen my understanding of the new client-server data fetching model in React and how it functions.

Feel free to dive in and explore!
